"The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.",These dazzling flowering shrubs were originally found only on the Channel Islands off the southern California coast. Plants were brought to the mainland and cultivated as garden ornamentals or as windbreaks sometime during the 19th century. The species has since naturalized locally on the mainland and is reproducing on its own. This could have been anticipated since the environmental conditions are so similar between the California coast and the nearby islands. Whether related species of Lavatera ever existed on the mainland remains a mystery.DISTRIBUTION: Rare along coastal bluffs on the Channel Islands; < 350 m.,"Little Elephant's Head has a corolla divided into two parts. The upper portion forms a beak-like process—the elephant's trunk. The lower portion has spreading lobes forming the drooping ears. The analogy is further strengthened by dark markings which simulate eyes. The flower accidentally looks like one kind of animal. Most species of Pedicularis (Louseworts), however, are named after another — the louse (pediculus). It was once erroneously thought that ingestion of these plants by cattle made them susceptible to infestation by lice.DISTRIBUTION: Wet meadows, stream margins, and bogs from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau, high Sierra Nevada, and White and Inyo Mts. of the Great Basin Province; 1500-3900 m.","The leaves of Mountain Heather superficialy look like pine needles. They are actually normally formed leaf blades with the margins rolled downward and tightly appressed to the lower surface. A colorful umbel-like cluster of flowers terminates the short erect branches. The broad bell-shaped flowers are divided into five shallow lobes surrounding 10 stamens and a style that project beyond the corolla margin. The scientific name of this species honors William H. Brewer (1828-1910), geologist and botanist who led numerous field parties for the California State Geological Survey from 1860 to 1864.DISTRIBUTION: Moist rocky subalpine slopes and meadows from the southern High Cascade and Sierra Nevada Ranges to the San Bernardino Mts.; 1200-3500 m.","Newberry's Beardtongue is commonly found on rocky ledges and gravelly slopes in the mountains of northern and central California, Oregon, and Nevada. It produces woody stems that creep along the ground to form a low mat. In rocky habitats, intense sunlight creates a warmer environment on the ground than exists within a few inches overhead. Hence a mat-forming plant takes advantage of this microclimate and also avoids the effects of gusty winds. During mid-summer ascending branches are covered with small dense clusters of rose-red somewhat woolly flowers. The narrow corolla, which is adapted for hummingbird pollination, is just over an inch long and only slightly dilated at the throat.DISTRIBUTION: Outcrops and talus from NW Calif. to the Cascade Ranges, high Sierra Nevada and N Tehachapi Mts.; 700-3500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage.

In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.",These dazzling flowering shrubs were originally found only on the Channel Islands off the southern California coast. Plants were brought to the mainland and cultivated as garden ornamentals or as windbreaks sometime during the 19th century. The species has since naturalized locally on the mainland and is reproducing on its own. This could have been anticipated since the environmental conditions are so similar between the California coast and the nearby islands. Whether related species of Lavatera ever existed on the mainland remains a mystery.DISTRIBUTION: Rare along coastal bluffs on the Channel Islands; < 350 m.,"Little Elephant's Head has a corolla divided into two parts. The upper portion forms a beak-like process—the elephant's trunk. The lower portion has spreading lobes forming the drooping ears. The analogy is further strengthened by dark markings which simulate eyes. The flower accidentally looks like one kind of animal. Most species of Pedicularis (Louseworts), however, are named after another — the louse (pediculus). It was once erroneously thought that ingestion of these plants by cattle made them susceptible to infestation by lice.DISTRIBUTION: Wet meadows, stream margins, and bogs from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau, high Sierra Nevada, and White and Inyo Mts. of the Great Basin Province; 1500-3900 m.","The leaves of Mountain Heather superficialy look like pine needles. They are actually normally formed leaf blades with the margins rolled downward and tightly appressed to the lower surface. A colorful umbel-like cluster of flowers terminates the short erect branches. The broad bell-shaped flowers are divided into five shallow lobes surrounding 10 stamens and a style that project beyond the corolla margin. The scientific name of this species honors William H. Brewer (1828-1910), geologist and botanist who led numerous field parties for the California State Geological Survey from 1860 to 1864.DISTRIBUTION: Moist rocky subalpine slopes and meadows from the southern High Cascade and Sierra Nevada Ranges to the San Bernardino Mts.; 1200-3500 m.","Newberry's Beardtongue is commonly found on rocky ledges and gravelly slopes in the mountains of northern and central California, Oregon, and Nevada. It produces woody stems that creep along the ground to form a low mat. In rocky habitats, intense sunlight creates a warmer environment on the ground than exists within a few inches overhead. Hence a mat-forming plant takes advantage of this microclimate and also avoids the effects of gusty winds. During mid-summer ascending branches are covered with small dense clusters of rose-red somewhat woolly flowers. The narrow corolla, which is adapted for hummingbird pollination, is just over an inch long and only slightly dilated at the throat.DISTRIBUTION: Outcrops and talus from NW Calif. to the Cascade Ranges, high Sierra Nevada and N Tehachapi Mts.; 700-3500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide.
