"Plants which grow in California's Great Central Valley have to survive from one rainy season to the next. On the other hand, plants of the Sierra Nevada are watered by the trickling snow melt. Thus streamside plants are guaranteed a constant water supply during the warm dry months of summer and early fall. The flowers of Alpine Lily are much smaller than those of Leopard Lily. Each plant may grow to a height of six feet and produce as many as 40 flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Wet meadows, willow thickets, and streams in coniferous forests in the northern and central High Sierra Nevada; 1400-2900 m.","The petals of the California Poppy have a sheen that magically transforms their orange color into metallic gold. How did California's state flower get its unusual scientific name—Eschscholzia? It is named for Johann Friedrich Eschscholtz (1793-1831), surgeon and naturalist with Russian expeditions to the Pacific Coast in 1816 and 1824. The flowering process of this poppy unfolds like a play. Each bud is enclosed by two fused sepals that are united into a cap that is pushed off by the four expanding petals. When the petals fall away, a pinkish rim becomes evident as a spreading collar at the base of the elongate developing capsule.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy areas and disturbed sites throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and western areas east of the Sierra Nevada to the Mojave Desert; 0-2000 m.","Here is a flower that you can really look up to. Under favorable conditions it can reach a height of 10 feet. The conspicuous anthers change color from magenta to purple or yellow, depending on the individual plant. Large colonies in the wild are a breathtaking site when found along streambanks or wet meadows. The flower pictured here was grown from seed at the Strybing Arboretum in San Francisco. Seeds can be purchased at the Tilden Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley.DISTRIBUTION: Moist places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1700 m.","The habit of this lotus is reminiscent of an unfolding rug. The very hairy leaves help to enhance its mat-like appearance and the bright yellow-orange flowers contrast with its nondescript underlying substrate. Pollination of the pea-like flowers is accomplished by bees in search of nectar. As a bee lands on the keel, which consists of two fused petals, the pollen-bearing stamens are exposed and cover the insect's abdomen with pollen. As the bee moves to another flower it deposits its pollen load on a receptive stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Oak, yellow and lodgepole pine and fir forests, open bracken meadows from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges, North Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Central and South Coasts to the Transverse and NE Peninsular Ranges and desert mts.; 850-2750 m.","Pine Hill Flannel Bush is rare in the wild. It is now propagated by nurseries for the garden trade. Only a few hundred of the thousands of species native to California are available to the home gardener. The species that are chosen for the retail trade tend to have the most spectacular flowers but scores of other drought tolerant species have equally attractive foliage. The flowers of Flannel Bush have no true petals. The sunset coloration of the petal-like sepals are even more resplendent than the lemon-yellow flowers of its better known relative, Fremontia.DISTRIBUTION: Rare on rocky ridges in the high Sierra Nevada (Pine Hill, El Dorado Co.); 2000 m.","The wide range of flower colors is produced by relatively few pigments. Red, orange, and yellow flowers owe their brilliant hues to a group of pigments called carotenoids. Similar pigments are responsible for some of the brilliant fall colors in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States. The striking flowers of Wind Poppy are accented by the green or purple-spotted tapered neck or claw at the base of each petal. The many dainty stamens of this species are well positioned for dusting the bodies of bees as they shuttle from flower to flower.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy areas and openings in chaparral from southern NW Calif to the southern Sierra Nevada Foothills and San Joaquin Valley to CW and SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","Plants which grow in California's Great Central Valley have to survive from one rainy season to the next.
