"The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation. This widespread species consists of a puzzling complex of intergrading morphological variants throughout its range. Leaf shape can also vary considerably on a single plant. The fruits developing from a single flower consist of many leathery disk- or wedged-shaped segments packed together in a circle like orange segments.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open places in forest, scrub, or grasslands throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; &lt; 2300 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Mint, oregano, sage, rosemary, basil, and thyme: all of these culinary delights are in the mint family. If a plant has square stems, opposite leaves, a bilaterally symmetrical flower, and produces a pleasant aromatic fragrance, it is probably a member of the family Lamiaceae. Flowers of the Fragrant Pitcher Sage are individually borne along arching branches. All petals are fused basally into a tube that emerges from a hairy calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in chaparral along the South Coast mainland and northern Channel Islands; < 1l00 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sectionsâ€”Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.","Calochortus nudus is named ""nude"" because its petals are simple and relatively unadorned when compared with the related C. elegans. The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The ghostly white glow of the Phantom Orchid is striking in the deep shade of its forest setting. This species grows only in the decomposing litter of the forest floor. It is snow white in color, lacks leaves, contains no chlorophyll, and cannot manufacture its own food. Saprophytes like this orchid obtain their food from organic material in the substrate through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail. The sepals are kidney shaped with a paper-thin margin. The petals are smaller than the sepals and are practically hidden from view. The persistence of petals on developing capsules of Pussypaws is unusual but not unique among flowering plants. The significance of this phenomenon is unknown but may serve a protective function.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy to rocky soils in coniferous forests and alpine habitats from the Klamath, Cascade, and High North Coast Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, southwest San Francisco Bay Area, and Great Basin Province; (100)1500-4300 m.","This species is a choice shrub for anyone interested in growing some of the woody members of our native flora. In February, the plant is covered with drooping clusters of clear pink flowers. Fruit maturation following pollination brings berries that the birds enjoy. This is all accentuated by the shapely leaves that develop appealing autumn colors.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the Outer South Coast Ranges; < 1000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison.

A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation. This widespread species consists of a puzzling complex of intergrading morphological variants throughout its range. Leaf shape can also vary considerably on a single plant. The fruits developing from a single flower consist of many leathery disk- or wedged-shaped segments packed together in a circle like orange segments.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open places in forest, scrub, or grasslands throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; &lt; 2300 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Mint, oregano, sage, rosemary, basil, and thyme: all of these culinary delights are in the mint family. If a plant has square stems, opposite leaves, a bilaterally symmetrical flower, and produces a pleasant aromatic fragrance, it is probably a member of the family Lamiaceae. Flowers of the Fragrant Pitcher Sage are individually borne along arching branches. All petals are fused basally into a tube that emerges from a hairy calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in chaparral along the South Coast mainland and northern Channel Islands; < 1l00 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sectionsâ€”Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.","Calochortus nudus is named ""nude"" because its petals are simple and relatively unadorned when compared with the related C. elegans. The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases.

This species grows only in the decomposing litter of the forest floor. It is snow white in color, lacks leaves, contains no chlorophyll, and cannot manufacture its own food. Saprophytes like this orchid obtain their food from organic material in the substrate through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail.

What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows.

Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Mint, oregano, sage, rosemary, basil, and thyme: all of these culinary delights are in the mint family. If a plant has square stems, opposite leaves, a bilaterally symmetrical flower, and produces a pleasant aromatic fragrance, it is probably a member of the family Lamiaceae. Flowers of the Fragrant Pitcher Sage are individually borne along arching branches. All petals are fused basally into a tube that emerges from a hairy calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in chaparral along the South Coast mainland and northern Channel Islands; < 1l00 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sectionsâ€”Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.","Calochortus nudus is named ""nude"" because its petals are simple and relatively unadorned when compared with the related C. elegans. The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The ghostly white glow of the Phantom Orchid is striking in the deep shade of its forest setting. This species grows only in the decomposing litter of the forest floor. It is snow white in color, lacks leaves, contains no chlorophyll, and cannot manufacture its own food. Saprophytes like this orchid obtain their food from organic material in the substrate through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail. The sepals are kidney shaped with a paper-thin margin. The petals are smaller than the sepals and are practically hidden from view. The persistence of petals on developing capsules of Pussypaws is unusual but not unique among flowering plants. The significance of this phenomenon is unknown but may serve a protective function.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy to rocky soils in coniferous forests and alpine habitats from the Klamath, Cascade, and High North Coast Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, southwest San Francisco Bay Area, and Great Basin Province; (100)1500-4300 m.","This species is a choice shrub for anyone interested in growing some of the woody members of our native flora. In February, the plant is covered with drooping clusters of clear pink flowers. Fruit maturation following pollination brings berries that the birds enjoy. This is all accentuated by the shapely leaves that develop appealing autumn colors.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the Outer South Coast Ranges; < 1000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species.

What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation.

All petals are fused basally into a tube that emerges from a hairy calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in chaparral along the South Coast mainland and northern Channel Islands; < 1l00 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sectionsâ€”Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.","Calochortus nudus is named ""nude"" because its petals are simple and relatively unadorned when compared with the related C. elegans. The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The ghostly white glow of the Phantom Orchid is striking in the deep shade of its forest setting. This species grows only in the decomposing litter of the forest floor. It is snow white in color, lacks leaves, contains no chlorophyll, and cannot manufacture its own food. Saprophytes like this orchid obtain their food from organic material in the substrate through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail. The sepals are kidney shaped with a paper-thin margin. The petals are smaller than the sepals and are practically hidden from view. The persistence of petals on developing capsules of Pussypaws is unusual but not unique among flowering plants. The significance of this phenomenon is unknown but may serve a protective function.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy to rocky soils in coniferous forests and alpine habitats from the Klamath, Cascade, and High North Coast Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, southwest San Francisco Bay Area, and Great Basin Province; (100)1500-4300 m.","This species is a choice shrub for anyone interested in growing some of the woody members of our native flora. In February, the plant is covered with drooping clusters of clear pink flowers. Fruit maturation following pollination brings berries that the birds enjoy. This is all accentuated by the shapely leaves that develop appealing autumn colors.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the Outer South Coast Ranges; < 1000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation. This widespread species consists of a puzzling complex of intergrading morphological variants throughout its range. Leaf shape can also vary considerably on a single plant. The fruits developing from a single flower consist of many leathery disk- or wedged-shaped segments packed together in a circle like orange segments.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open places in forest, scrub, or grasslands throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; &lt; 2300 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer.

The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases. This floral feature is found in both Oregon Checkerbloom and in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), another member of the mallow or hibiscus family.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and streambanks from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the northern and central High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province; 1100-3000 m.","The ghostly white glow of the Phantom Orchid is striking in the deep shade of its forest setting. This species grows only in the decomposing litter of the forest floor. It is snow white in color, lacks leaves, contains no chlorophyll, and cannot manufacture its own food. Saprophytes like this orchid obtain their food from organic material in the substrate through a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi. Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail. The sepals are kidney shaped with a paper-thin margin. The petals are smaller than the sepals and are practically hidden from view.

The significance of this phenomenon is unknown but may serve a protective function.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy to rocky soils in coniferous forests and alpine habitats from the Klamath, Cascade, and High North Coast Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, southwest San Francisco Bay Area, and Great Basin Province; (100)1500-4300 m.","This species is a choice shrub for anyone interested in growing some of the woody members of our native flora. In February, the plant is covered with drooping clusters of clear pink flowers. Fruit maturation following pollination brings berries that the birds enjoy. This is all accentuated by the shapely leaves that develop appealing autumn colors.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the Outer South Coast Ranges; < 1000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation. This widespread species consists of a puzzling complex of intergrading morphological variants throughout its range. Leaf shape can also vary considerably on a single plant. The fruits developing from a single flower consist of many leathery disk- or wedged-shaped segments packed together in a circle like orange segments.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open places in forest, scrub, or grasslands throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; &lt; 2300 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces.

Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Mint, oregano, sage, rosemary, basil, and thyme: all of these culinary delights are in the mint family. If a plant has square stems, opposite leaves, a bilaterally symmetrical flower, and produces a pleasant aromatic fragrance, it is probably a member of the family Lamiaceae.

Of the 15 species of Cephalanthera, the Phantom Orchid is the only one found outside of the Eastern hemisphere and the only species of its genus to be totally dependent on fungi for survival.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposed litter of rich soil in mixed evergreen or coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay Area, the northern outer South Coast Ranges and San Bernardino Mts.; 300-1200 m.","The individual flowers are tightly packed along a curved stem which is shaped like a scorpion's tail. The sepals are kidney shaped with a paper-thin margin. The petals are smaller than the sepals and are practically hidden from view. The persistence of petals on developing capsules of Pussypaws is unusual but not unique among flowering plants. The significance of this phenomenon is unknown but may serve a protective function.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy to rocky soils in coniferous forests and alpine habitats from the Klamath, Cascade, and High North Coast Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, southwest San Francisco Bay Area, and Great Basin Province; (100)1500-4300 m.","This species is a choice shrub for anyone interested in growing some of the woody members of our native flora. In February, the plant is covered with drooping clusters of clear pink flowers. Fruit maturation following pollination brings berries that the birds enjoy. This is all accentuated by the shapely leaves that develop appealing autumn colors.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the Outer South Coast Ranges; < 1000 m.","The young buds of Red Ribbons are covered by long thin sepals. The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.","Monkeyflowers are unusual in having a peculiar two-lobed stigma that is irritable when touched. A bee entering a flower brushes first against the stigma, whose two lobes fold together quickly and lie tightly pressed against the upper surface of the corolla tube. In so doing, the stigma with its pollen load is positioned in a way that makes the bee come into contact with the flower's anthers which lie behind the lower stigmatic lobe. This active movement mechanism insures pollen reception by the stigma and pollen deposition on the insect for subsequent flower visits.DISTRIBUTION: Common in moist places near seepage areas and streams from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and High Sierra Nevada south to the San Bernardino and San Jacinto Mts.; 1200-3400 m.","The richly colored pink petals of checkerbloom are made even more luminous by the white petal venation. This widespread species consists of a puzzling complex of intergrading morphological variants throughout its range. Leaf shape can also vary considerably on a single plant. The fruits developing from a single flower consist of many leathery disk- or wedged-shaped segments packed together in a circle like orange segments.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open places in forest, scrub, or grasslands throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; &lt; 2300 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","The genus Clarkia was named for Captain William Clark (1770-1838) of the Lewis and Clark Expedition which was sent by Thomas Jefferson to find the Northwest Passage. Among the extensive botanical collections made on this expedition were species of Clarkia. Farewell-to-Spring is probably the showiest and most common species of Clarkia to be found in the rolling coastal slopes of the San Francisco Bay Area during late spring and early summer. Its large bowl-shaped flowers are readily recognized in profile view because of the erect or ascending rosy-pink to lavender petals that are bright red or purplish at the base.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy slopes and openings in woodland, forest, and chaparral along the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; < 500 m.","Mint, oregano, sage, rosemary, basil, and thyme: all of these culinary delights are in the mint family. If a plant has square stems, opposite leaves, a bilaterally symmetrical flower, and produces a pleasant aromatic fragrance, it is probably a member of the family Lamiaceae. Flowers of the Fragrant Pitcher Sage are individually borne along arching branches. All petals are fused basally into a tube that emerges from a hairy calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in chaparral along the South Coast mainland and northern Channel Islands; < 1l00 m.","Fringe Cups often grow on moist north-facing slopes along streams. The thick scaly underground stems give rise to a basal cluster of kidney- or heart-shaped leaves. Fully expanded flowers may resemble buds because the petals are small and deeply cut into narrow pointed lobes. The flower consists of a tubular five-lobed calyx, five petals, ten stamens, and a one-chambered, two-beaked ovary that matures into a capsule releasing its seeds longitudinally between the beaks.DISTRIBUTION: Moist slopes from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada and CW Calif.; < 2000 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sectionsâ€”Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.","Calochortus nudus is named ""nude"" because its petals are simple and relatively unadorned when compared with the related C. elegans. The latter is similar in many respects except that its petals are so hairy that it is given the common name ""Cat's Ear"". Calochortus, like other lilies generally have leaves with parallel veins, three petals and three petal-like sepals.DISTRIBUTION: Moist grassy or rocky areas, bog and lake margins from the Klamath Range to the High Cascade Range; 1200-2500 m.","Because they share a common ancestry many genera and species in a particular plant family also share structural features. For the Malvaceae, the filaments of the many stamens are fused into a tube surrounding the style which is in turn fused to the petal bases.

The sepals of most plants peel back as one would peel a banana to reveal the inner floral parts. In this species the sepals split and separate up to the apex where they remain fused. The entire calyx structure then becomes deflexed to one side of the flower as the petals expand. The burnt orange or red-pink sepals contrast sharply with the pink, white-streaked petals that are each 3-lobed.DISTRIBUTION: Mixed evergreen forests, woodlands, and coastal scrub from NW Calif. to the northern Sierra Nevada Foothills, San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Coast; < 1500 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","Western Azalea shows a preference for seepage areas and the banks of streams. Its spicy floral fragrance is frequently detected long before one spots the large pinkish-white flowers that are flushed with a basal patch of yellow. In Oregon it is called honeysuckle. Botanists and plant enthusiasts in California prefer using its scientific name or Western Azalea because the name honeysuckle is traditionally reserved for Lonicera (true honeysuckle), a genus of erect or twining berry-fruited shrubs in a totally different family, the Caprifoliaceae.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks and seeps in coniferous forests from the North and Central Coast, North and South Coast Ranges and San Francisco Bay Area to the San Jacinto Mts. of southern Calif.; < 2200 m.","Clarkias are annuals with edible seeds that grow abundantly in open woodlands and grassy meadows. Native Americans collected Clarkia seeds by swinging a tennis racket-shaped seedbeater, thereby knocking the seeds into baskets. Regular burning of meadow habitats removed thatch and enriched the soil. Some of the harvested seed was then used to reseed the meadow. Due to modern day fire suppression policies, meadows that once supported large populations of Clarkia have become overgrown by shrubby perennials.DISTRIBUTION: Very local and rare in foothill woodlands of the Cascade Ranges (Butte Co.); 500 m.","The genus Allium, which includes onions, shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic includes about 500 species worldwide. Because species in this genus share a remarkably uniform floral morphology, it often takes a microscope to tell them apart. The surface patterns of the bulb coat provide the most useful features when attempting to distinguish the many species. In Allium unifolium the bulb coat is made up of wavy lines crossing like a jigsaw puzzle.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in moist clay or serpentine, especially grassy streambanks from western NW Calif. to central western Calif.; < 1100 m."
