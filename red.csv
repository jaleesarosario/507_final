"Applegate's Indian Paintbrush is a green root-parasite that taps into the water and nutrient supply of neighboring shrubs. It is actually called a hemiparasite because it can grow independently. Many hemiparasites take up a contact relationship with their hosts immediately after seed germination. Although they are green and capable of fixing appreciable amounts of carbon via photosynthesis, they grow poorly under these circumstances. Studies have shown that as soon as a hemiparasite makes contact with a host, growth rate improves greatly and the plant becomes much more vigorous.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and dry open forest or scrub throughout Calif.; 300-3600 m.","The generic name Penstemon is derived from Greek words meaning five stamens. Four of the stamens are easily seen. They arch out under the upper lip of the corolla. The fifth does not produce pollen, and is called a staminode. It lies along the floor of the floral tube. Other species of Penstemon have hairy staminodes which give this genus the common name Beardtongue. This redflowered species has a smooth ""tongue"" so perhaps it should be called the ""Shaved Beardtongue"".DISTRIBUTION: Juniper/pinyon woodland, pine and mixed hardwood forests through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; 1500-2400 m.","Cardinal Monkeyflower typically grows along streams and seepage areas. The shape of the corolla differs markedly from the other 100 or so species of Mimulus. The corolla is essentially two-lipped. The upper half arches forward instead of flaring like it does in so many other species. The lower lip is folded or reflexed and accentuated by yellow hairy ridges. Unlike many monkeyflowers which are pollinated by bees, this scarlet flowered perennial is pollinated by hummingbirds.DISTRIBUTION: Seepage areas and moist to wet places along streams throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2400 m.","This Columbine is one of several hummingbird flowers that blooms from mid to late summer in the high Sierra Nevada. The red flowers of this species are regularly visited by the Calliope hummingbirds that breed in these forests and by migrants such as the Rufous and Allen's Hummingbird. Each of the five petals of this species is shaped like a deep ice cream cone or spur that produces copious amounts of nectar. Studies have shown that nectar yield is an important factor in competition between Columbine and several other plant species for pollination by hummingbirds.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, seeps, moist places, chaparral, oak woodland, and mixed-evergreen or coniferous forest throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley, South Coast, and Channel Islands), Great Basin Province, and desert mountains; < 3300 m.","When one mentions wildflowers, one usually thinks of flowers with colorful silky petals. The petals of fairyduster are so small that they are hard to find in each tight head-like cluster that consists of numerous flowers. The most conspicuous feature of these flowers resides not in their petals but in their stamens. The stamens form an unusual grouping that looks something like a peacock's crown. The dense clusters of stamens extend far beyond the petals giving the species its duster nickname.DISTRIBUTION: Rare in sandy washes, slopes, and mesas of the Sonoran Desert; 1500 m.","Keckiella cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves. This is reflected in the species name, cordifolia, or heart leaf. The name Keckiella honors David D. Keck (1903-   ). He and Philip A. Munz authored a major treatise entitled A California Flora in 1959. This species can grow to a height of three meters. Its open drooping habit often gives it an ungainly appearance. The deep red flowers are borne in compact terminal clusters. The stalk or pedicel of each flower can sometimes be twisted on the long arching branches in a way that makes for an upside-down orientation. This inversion created by twisting of the pedicel is called resupinate.DISTRIBUTION: In forest and chaparral from the southern outer South Coast Ranges to SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","The glorious flower color of the hedgehog cactus rivals that of the desert sunset. Cacti can survive in arid regions because they have a combination of adaptive features â€” lack of leaves, succulent stems, spines in areoles, and shallow spreading root systems. The cactus spine which functions to discourage browsing, is developed from a leaf or a part of one. The areole in which the spines sit is a modified side shoot borne above the normal position of a leaf.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats in the Desert Province; 150-3500 m.","Castilleja has reversed nature's usual color assignment of green for leaves and red for petals. Most of the brilliant color in the flower spike is contributed by the bracts. Bracts are modified leaves, one of which is inserted below each flower. In this species, each bract is shaped like a bird's foot. The tubular flowers are partially hidden from view by the bracts. They are tricolored, with red and yellow flushed with green.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coastal scrub from the North Coast and outer North Coast Ranges to the foothills of the Cascade Ranges and Sierra Nevada to CW and SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","This Indian Paintbrush is able to grow in serpentine soil. Serpentine soils are high in magnesium, low in calcium, and laden with metals like chromium and nickel which are needed by plants in trace amounts. Some plant species are narrowly restricted to one or a few neighboring outcrops of serpentine. In California alone, some 215 plant taxa are restricted wholly or in large part to serpentine soils. Most plant species are ill-equipped to survive the stressful chemical make-up of serpentine habitats.

Studies have shown that as soon as a hemiparasite makes contact with a host, growth rate improves greatly and the plant becomes much more vigorous.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows and dry open forest or scrub throughout Calif.; 300-3600 m.","The generic name Penstemon is derived from Greek words meaning five stamens. Four of the stamens are easily seen. They arch out under the upper lip of the corolla. The fifth does not produce pollen, and is called a staminode. It lies along the floor of the floral tube. Other species of Penstemon have hairy staminodes which give this genus the common name Beardtongue. This redflowered species has a smooth ""tongue"" so perhaps it should be called the ""Shaved Beardtongue"".DISTRIBUTION: Juniper/pinyon woodland, pine and mixed hardwood forests through the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; 1500-2400 m.","Cardinal Monkeyflower typically grows along streams and seepage areas. The shape of the corolla differs markedly from the other 100 or so species of Mimulus. The corolla is essentially two-lipped. The upper half arches forward instead of flaring like it does in so many other species. The lower lip is folded or reflexed and accentuated by yellow hairy ridges. Unlike many monkeyflowers which are pollinated by bees, this scarlet flowered perennial is pollinated by hummingbirds.DISTRIBUTION: Seepage areas and moist to wet places along streams throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2400 m.","This Columbine is one of several hummingbird flowers that blooms from mid to late summer in the high Sierra Nevada. The red flowers of this species are regularly visited by the Calliope hummingbirds that breed in these forests and by migrants such as the Rufous and Allen's Hummingbird. Each of the five petals of this species is shaped like a deep ice cream cone or spur that produces copious amounts of nectar. Studies have shown that nectar yield is an important factor in competition between Columbine and several other plant species for pollination by hummingbirds.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, seeps, moist places, chaparral, oak woodland, and mixed-evergreen or coniferous forest throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley, South Coast, and Channel Islands), Great Basin Province, and desert mountains; < 3300 m.","When one mentions wildflowers, one usually thinks of flowers with colorful silky petals. The petals of fairyduster are so small that they are hard to find in each tight head-like cluster that consists of numerous flowers. The most conspicuous feature of these flowers resides not in their petals but in their stamens. The stamens form an unusual grouping that looks something like a peacock's crown. The dense clusters of stamens extend far beyond the petals giving the species its duster nickname.DISTRIBUTION: Rare in sandy washes, slopes, and mesas of the Sonoran Desert; 1500 m.","Keckiella cordifolia has heart-shaped leaves. This is reflected in the species name, cordifolia, or heart leaf. The name Keckiella honors David D. Keck (1903-   ). He and Philip A. Munz authored a major treatise entitled A California Flora in 1959. This species can grow to a height of three meters. Its open drooping habit often gives it an ungainly appearance. The deep red flowers are borne in compact terminal clusters. The stalk or pedicel of each flower can sometimes be twisted on the long arching branches in a way that makes for an upside-down orientation. This inversion created by twisting of the pedicel is called resupinate.DISTRIBUTION: In forest and chaparral from the southern outer South Coast Ranges to SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","The glorious flower color of the hedgehog cactus rivals that of the desert sunset. Cacti can survive in arid regions because they have a combination of adaptive features â€” lack of leaves, succulent stems, spines in areoles, and shallow spreading root systems. The cactus spine which functions to discourage browsing, is developed from a leaf or a part of one. The areole in which the spines sit is a modified side shoot borne above the normal position of a leaf.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats in the Desert Province; 150-3500 m.","Castilleja has reversed nature's usual color assignment of green for leaves and red for petals. Most of the brilliant color in the flower spike is contributed by the bracts. Bracts are modified leaves, one of which is inserted below each flower. In this species, each bract is shaped like a bird's foot. The tubular flowers are partially hidden from view by the bracts. They are tricolored, with red and yellow flushed with green.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coastal scrub from the North Coast and outer North Coast Ranges to the foothills of the Cascade Ranges and Sierra Nevada to CW and SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","This Indian Paintbrush is able to grow in serpentine soil. Serpentine soils are high in magnesium, low in calcium, and laden with metals like chromium and nickel which are needed by plants in trace amounts. Some plant species are narrowly restricted to one or a few neighboring outcrops of serpentine. In California alone, some 215 plant taxa are restricted wholly or in large part to serpentine soils. Most plant species are ill-equipped to survive the stressful chemical make-up of serpentine habitats. Thus this Paintbrush and other serpentine adapted plants have free reign there.DISTRIBUTION: Dry open serpentine or forest edges from NW Calif. to the Cascade Ranges, Modoc Plateau, N & C Sierra Nevada, and San Gabriel Mts.; 500-2200 m.","Among members of the Lily family, Old World tulips are much loved and grown worldwide. Calochortus, the Mariposa Lily or Mariposa Tulip, is a related group of native bulbous perennial herbs with grass-like leaves. Mariposa Lilies are not as widely known as tulips but they win instant and enthusiastic admiration from all who discover them. Their simple but elegant flowers are adorned with elaborate hairy nectaries at the base of each petal. The shape, position, and bearded adornments of these nectaries are important characters for species identification.DISTRIBUTION: Heavy or rocky soils in creosote-bush scrub and pinyon-juniper woodland from the Transverse Ranges to the Mojave Desert; 600-2200 m.","Ipomopsis is derived from a Greek work meaning ""striking appearance"". The striking trumpet-shaped, odorless flowers are arranged in compact 1-sided clusters. The corolla is red, highlighted with yellow or white mottling in the throat. The stamens are attached to the corolla tube and are described in botanical descriptions as epipetalous, or on the petal. The principal pollinators of Scarlet Gilia are hummingbirds. As they probe for nectar in the slender-tubed flowers, these birds pick up and carry pollen on their heads and bills from one plant to another.DISTRIBUTION: Montane shrublands from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the Modoc Plateau and northern and central High Sierra Nevada; 100-2500 m.","This large deciduous shrub is noted for its aromatic fragrance. Some people describe the fragrance as sweet and pleasant while others find it disagreeable. Descriptions of the odor range from ""similar to the inside of a wine barrel"" to ""pleasantly bitter"". The conspicuous flower parts consist of similarly colored sepals and petals arranged in several overlapping series with a gradual transition from sepals to petals. The outermost in the series are distinctly scale-like, the remainder showy and petal-like. The fruits are one-seeded achenes enclosed in an enlarged leathery receptacle.DISTRIBUTION: Moist shady places, canyons, and streambanks from the southern Cascade Ranges, Inner and Outer N Coast Ranges, Sierra Nevada Foothills, and central and southern High Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","Like the Phantom Orchid, The Spotted Coralroot has a mycorrhizal association with fungi but the plants are not completely without chlorophyll and vary in color from purple through reds and browns to clear yellow. The sepals and petals are usually orange-brown and the white lip (broad lower petal) is deeply 3-lobed and prominently marked with red-violet. The flower's spotted lower lip and the coral-like appearance of the branching underground rhizome combine to give the Spotted Coralroot its common name.DISTRIBUTION: Decomposing leaf litter in shaded coniferous forests from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, SW San Francisco Bay Area, and the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; < 2800 m.","The wide range of flower colors is produced by relatively few pigments. Red, orange, and yellow flowers owe their brilliant hues to a group of pigments called carotenoids. Similar pigments are responsible for some of the brilliant fall colors in the deciduous forests of the eastern United States. The striking flowers of Wind Poppy are accented by the green or purple-spotted tapered neck or claw at the base of each petal. The many dainty stamens of this species are well positioned for dusting the bodies of bees as they shuttle from flower to flower.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy areas and openings in chaparral from southern NW Calif to the southern Sierra Nevada Foothills and San Joaquin Valley to CW and SW Calif.; < 1200 m.","Green plants need carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to carry out photosynthesis. They have to open their stomata (minute openings in the epidermis of leaves and stems) to let the gas in. Water evaporates from the stomata at the same time. If the water is not replaced by the roots, which can occur in the dry desert climate, plants can dry out and eventually die. To circumvent this problem, some cacti are largely dependent upon nighttime accumulation of carbon for photosynthesis because their stomata are closed during the day to retard water loss. This is advantageous under the conditions of high light intensity and water stress under which many succulent plants live.DISTRIBUTION: Dry places above valley floors above the western edge of the Sonoran Desert; 300-1200 m."
