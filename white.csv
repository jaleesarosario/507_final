"Its Latin name occupies more space than this diminutive plant! Here we have a Latin name that consists of three parts—the genus, the species, and the variety. Different varieties of a species bear an overall resemblance to one another but exhibit one or more important differences. The petal color of this variety (white with black dots) differentiates it from the other two varieties of this species.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs and grassy slopes from NW Calif. to the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; 15-1500 m.","The coastal Miwok Indians consumed the fruits of this species. The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 200-2500 m.",The small fruit consists of two seeds clasped together like hands covered with velcro-like bristles. Plants are tap-rooted like a carrot. The leaves of this annual are finely divided and form a handsome pattern. The white flowers are tiny and inconspicuous.DISTRIBUTION: Shady places in western areas of the Calif. Floristic Province; 0-400 m; Native to Eurasia.,"Think of the challenge of naming the 200 genera and approximately 5500 species in the mint family. It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets. Each leaflet is further divided into numerous oblique lobes that render a fernlike grace to the entire plant. This species occurs naturally only on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Clemente islands off the southern California coast. Unfortunately, the grazing pressures of introduced feral goats and other herbivores present a real threat to Ironwood and many other Channel Island plants.DISTRIBUTION: Rare and threatened by grazing in canyons, rocky slopes, oak woodland, and chaparral on the Channel Islands; 20-500 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","From the melting winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges of California emerge the stout stems and robust leaves which give this species its corn-like appearance and hence the name Corn Lily. The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and Modoc Plateau; 1000-3500 m.","Romneya coulteri holds the record for having the largest flowers of any plant native to California. Each flower spreads out like an egg cracked into a frying pan. The six crinkled white petals surround the sunny-side-up yellow center of multiple stamens. The extraordinary flower and imposing habit of this poppy have made it a prized garden ornamental in California and other parts of the world. Once established, its creeping underground rhizomes give rise to a vigorous colony that can spread well beyond the parent plant.DISTRIBUTION: Dry washes and canyons from the eastern South Coast to the Peninsular Ranges; < 1200 m.","The Hercules of the carrot family is easy to spot on moist hillsides. The leaves are divided into three leaflets. Each huge leaflet is maple-like and may be up to two feet across. The flowers have unequal petals and are arranged in what is known as ""umbels"" or umbrella shaped clusters of numerous flowers. The stem is stout and hollow.DISTRIBUTION: Moist places in open or wooded areas; Calif. Floristic Province and Great Basin Province; < 2600 m.","This species has flowers that exhibit patterns of white, yellow, and yellow-gold. Five petal color patterns exist in natural populations of Cream Cups—1) entirely white, 2) white background with yellow basal spot, 3) white background with yellow petal tips, 4) white background with yellow basal spot and yellow tips, 5) and entirely yellow-gold. Because this species is not capable of self-fertilization, one might predict that differential pollinator attractiveness is a primary factor in the reproductive success of the different color morphs. Recent studies indicate that solitary bees are the most effective pollinators of Cream Cups but the bees show no consistent preference among the color morphs. Surprisingly, it has been found that this species is unusual among annual species in that wind is an important pollination mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands, sandy soils, and burned areas throughout the Calif. Floristic Province and W Desert Province; < 1000 m.","The bulbs of the Death Camas are poisonous to livestock and humans. In fact, consumption of this plant caused serious illness among some people of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Many other members of the Liliaceae are culinary delights, as onion and garlic lovers will attest. The use of plants for food by humans is a prehistoric tradition. Many of the 7000 edible plants that are used today were trial and error discoveries by ancient people.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy or wooded slopes and outcrops from NW Calif. to the Sacramento Valley south to CW and SW Calif.; < 1000 m.","Unlike most animals, flowering plants cannot move about to seek their mates. By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters. Each flower consists of 4-7 brilliant white petals that form a backdrop for a radiant whorl of yellow stamens. The flowers are typically arranged in a grouping called a cyme. This is a flat-topped or convex flower cluster with central flowers opening first.DISTRIBUTION: Rare along streambanks, chaparral, and oak woodland in the central and southern Sierra Nevada Foothills; 450-1000 m.","Look in fresh water and mud for the water plantain. The tapered oval leaves have a checkerboard appearance with veins parallel to the central vein, and connecting transverse veinlets. Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley) and Great Basin Province; < 3400 m.","The name Mock Orange refers both to the appearance of the flowers and to their captivating fragrance. This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing. When left unmowed the 1-2 foot feathery-leaved stems produce a flat cluster of flowers, consisting of both ray and disk flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats throughout Calif. except the deserts; < 3500 m.","The moisture loving Yerba Mansa has spinach-like leaves that arise from a stout aromatic rhizome (underground stem). It thrives in saline and alkaline soils that many plants find inhospitable. You are not observing one flower but a whole group of flowers arranged in an elongate cluster that superficially resembles an anemone flower. What look like petals are in fact white petaloid bracts (modified leaves). Each flower of 6 or 8 stamens and 3 fused pistils is subtended by a smaller white bract.DISTRIBUTION: Common in saline or alkaline soil, wet or moist areas, seeps, and springs from the sw Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast and South Coast Ranges to the northern and southern Channel Islands, Peninsular Ranges, and Mojave Desert; 75-1700 m.","Its Latin name occupies more space than this diminutive plant!

The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif.

Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat.

By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column.

This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing.

The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets. Each leaflet is further divided into numerous oblique lobes that render a fernlike grace to the entire plant. This species occurs naturally only on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Clemente islands off the southern California coast. Unfortunately, the grazing pressures of introduced feral goats and other herbivores present a real threat to Ironwood and many other Channel Island plants.DISTRIBUTION: Rare and threatened by grazing in canyons, rocky slopes, oak woodland, and chaparral on the Channel Islands; 20-500 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces.

The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif.

The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

In fact, consumption of this plant caused serious illness among some people of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Many other members of the Liliaceae are culinary delights, as onion and garlic lovers will attest. The use of plants for food by humans is a prehistoric tradition. Many of the 7000 edible plants that are used today were trial and error discoveries by ancient people.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy or wooded slopes and outcrops from NW Calif. to the Sacramento Valley south to CW and SW Calif.; < 1000 m.","Unlike most animals, flowering plants cannot move about to seek their mates. By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures.

What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances.

The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips.

When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex.

Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif.

When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex.

In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters.

Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds.

Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation.

By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches.

Many other members of the Liliaceae are culinary delights, as onion and garlic lovers will attest. The use of plants for food by humans is a prehistoric tradition. Many of the 7000 edible plants that are used today were trial and error discoveries by ancient people.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy or wooded slopes and outcrops from NW Calif. to the Sacramento Valley south to CW and SW Calif.; < 1000 m.","Unlike most animals, flowering plants cannot move about to seek their mates. By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants.

What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif.

Five petal color patterns exist in natural populations of Cream Cups—1) entirely white, 2) white background with yellow basal spot, 3) white background with yellow petal tips, 4) white background with yellow basal spot and yellow tips, 5) and entirely yellow-gold. Because this species is not capable of self-fertilization, one might predict that differential pollinator attractiveness is a primary factor in the reproductive success of the different color morphs. Recent studies indicate that solitary bees are the most effective pollinators of Cream Cups but the bees show no consistent preference among the color morphs.

Five petal color patterns exist in natural populations of Cream Cups—1) entirely white, 2) white background with yellow basal spot, 3) white background with yellow petal tips, 4) white background with yellow basal spot and yellow tips, 5) and entirely yellow-gold. Because this species is not capable of self-fertilization, one might predict that differential pollinator attractiveness is a primary factor in the reproductive success of the different color morphs. Recent studies indicate that solitary bees are the most effective pollinators of Cream Cups but the bees show no consistent preference among the color morphs.

In fact, consumption of this plant caused serious illness among some people of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Many other members of the Liliaceae are culinary delights, as onion and garlic lovers will attest. The use of plants for food by humans is a prehistoric tradition. Many of the 7000 edible plants that are used today were trial and error discoveries by ancient people.DISTRIBUTION: Grassy or wooded slopes and outcrops from NW Calif. to the Sacramento Valley south to CW and SW Calif.; < 1000 m.","Unlike most animals, flowering plants cannot move about to seek their mates. By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column.

The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

Each flower of 6 or 8 stamens and 3 fused pistils is subtended by a smaller white bract.DISTRIBUTION: Common in saline or alkaline soil, wet or moist areas, seeps, and springs from the sw Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast and South Coast Ranges to the northern and southern Channel Islands, Peninsular Ranges, and Mojave Desert; 75-1700 m.","Its Latin name occupies more space than this diminutive plant! Here we have a Latin name that consists of three parts—the genus, the species, and the variety. Different varieties of a species bear an overall resemblance to one another but exhibit one or more important differences. The petal color of this variety (white with black dots) differentiates it from the other two varieties of this species.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs and grassy slopes from NW Calif. to the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; 15-1500 m.","The coastal Miwok Indians consumed the fruits of this species. The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

Unfortunately, the grazing pressures of introduced feral goats and other herbivores present a real threat to Ironwood and many other Channel Island plants.DISTRIBUTION: Rare and threatened by grazing in canyons, rocky slopes, oak woodland, and chaparral on the Channel Islands; 20-500 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","From the melting winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges of California emerge the stout stems and robust leaves which give this species its corn-like appearance and hence the name Corn Lily. The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif.

By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif.

Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

The tapered oval leaves have a checkerboard appearance with veins parallel to the central vein, and connecting transverse veinlets. Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley) and Great Basin Province; < 3400 m.","The name Mock Orange refers both to the appearance of the flowers and to their captivating fragrance. This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing.

The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers.

Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters. Each flower consists of 4-7 brilliant white petals that form a backdrop for a radiant whorl of yellow stamens. The flowers are typically arranged in a grouping called a cyme. This is a flat-topped or convex flower cluster with central flowers opening first.DISTRIBUTION: Rare along streambanks, chaparral, and oak woodland in the central and southern Sierra Nevada Foothills; 450-1000 m.","Look in fresh water and mud for the water plantain. The tapered oval leaves have a checkerboard appearance with veins parallel to the central vein, and connecting transverse veinlets. Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley) and Great Basin Province; < 3400 m.","The name Mock Orange refers both to the appearance of the flowers and to their captivating fragrance. This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing.

The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets. Each leaflet is further divided into numerous oblique lobes that render a fernlike grace to the entire plant. This species occurs naturally only on Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Clemente islands off the southern California coast. Unfortunately, the grazing pressures of introduced feral goats and other herbivores present a real threat to Ironwood and many other Channel Island plants.DISTRIBUTION: Rare and threatened by grazing in canyons, rocky slopes, oak woodland, and chaparral on the Channel Islands; 20-500 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces.

Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","From the melting winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges of California emerge the stout stems and robust leaves which give this species its corn-like appearance and hence the name Corn Lily. The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif.

Five petal color patterns exist in natural populations of Cream Cups—1) entirely white, 2) white background with yellow basal spot, 3) white background with yellow petal tips, 4) white background with yellow basal spot and yellow tips, 5) and entirely yellow-gold. Because this species is not capable of self-fertilization, one might predict that differential pollinator attractiveness is a primary factor in the reproductive success of the different color morphs. Recent studies indicate that solitary bees are the most effective pollinators of Cream Cups but the bees show no consistent preference among the color morphs. Surprisingly, it has been found that this species is unusual among annual species in that wind is an important pollination mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands, sandy soils, and burned areas throughout the Calif.

The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape.

The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

Each flower of 6 or 8 stamens and 3 fused pistils is subtended by a smaller white bract.DISTRIBUTION: Common in saline or alkaline soil, wet or moist areas, seeps, and springs from the sw Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast and South Coast Ranges to the northern and southern Channel Islands, Peninsular Ranges, and Mojave Desert; 75-1700 m.","Its Latin name occupies more space than this diminutive plant! Here we have a Latin name that consists of three parts—the genus, the species, and the variety. Different varieties of a species bear an overall resemblance to one another but exhibit one or more important differences. The petal color of this variety (white with black dots) differentiates it from the other two varieties of this species.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs and grassy slopes from NW Calif. to the Central Coast and San Francisco Bay Area; 15-1500 m.","The coastal Miwok Indians consumed the fruits of this species. The nodes of the red horizontal stems commonly give rise to new roots that help to anchor plants in the shifting sand and wind of its coastal dune habitat. The central portion of each flower consists of a dome of pistils surrounded by stamens. The many pistils are borne on a fleshy receptacle that enlarges into a juicy strawberry. The crunchy consistency of strawberries is due to the shell-like wall of the many achenes—the hard dry one-seeded fruits borne on the surface of the fleshy red pulp.DISTRIBUTION: Ocean beaches, grasslands, and coastal bluffs along the Central and North Coast; < 200 m.","The generic name Apocynum, is derived from the Greek ""apo"" meaning away from, and ""kuon"" meaning dog, alluding to its ancient use as a dog poison. Ingestion of any part of this plant can cause poisoning and sometimes death to cattle, sheep, and horses. Because the milky sap is bitter, the plants are usually avoided. The bell-shaped flowers have five petals which are united at the base with lobes that separate and curl outward at the tips. A related species, Apocynum cannabinum (Indian Hemp) was an important source of strong fiber for making ropes and baskets.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky slopes and open places with conifers or chaparral throughout the Calif.

It has been said that when a botanist attempts to place a species in a given genus, the primary question should be, whether or not it is related to the undoubted species of that genus. The key character that distinguishes the natural assemblage of species placed in the genus Scutellaria involves morphology of the calyx. An erect, rounded appendage on the upper side of the tubular calyx reminded the author of the genus of a skullcap, and hence the common and scientific name. Scutellaria is derived from scutella, Latin for a small dish or saucer, in reference to the adorned calyx.DISTRIBUTION: Open sites, shrublands and woodlands from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the northern Sierra Nevada; 700-2000 m.","This rare tree with reddish brown peeling bark has compound leaves that are divided into 2-7 leaflets.

Unfortunately, the grazing pressures of introduced feral goats and other herbivores present a real threat to Ironwood and many other Channel Island plants.DISTRIBUTION: Rare and threatened by grazing in canyons, rocky slopes, oak woodland, and chaparral on the Channel Islands; 20-500 m.","If you hike to Point Bonita Lighthouse in the Marin Headlands, you will see the Coast Buckwheat growing in the cracks of smooth rock faces. Given its ability to survive in such a habitat, it is no wonder that this species can survive in a garden setting and tolerate benign neglect. The flower color of this Buckwheat is highly variable. Different flowers on the same cluster can be white, pink, red, or a mixture of all three colors.DISTRIBUTION: Common on coastal bluffs along the North and Central Coast of Calif.; < 150 m.","From the melting winter snow pack in the Sierra Nevada and other mountain ranges of California emerge the stout stems and robust leaves which give this species its corn-like appearance and hence the name Corn Lily. The star-shaped flowers have a distinctive green marking in the shape of a ""Y"" at the base of each white petal and sepal. Nature's insurance policy is illustrated here by flowers opening successively over a long period of time. If any untoward event such as a cold snap were to interrupt pollinator activity, flowers which open after the episode can be pollinated to produce a seed crop for the next generation.DISTRIBUTION: Streambanks, moist meadows, and forest margins throughout the Calif.

By attracting insects and other animals and providing behavioral cues so that a high frequency of cross pollination results, flowering plants have in a sense transcended their immobile condition. Bees, which find Fivespot to be an attention grabber, are the most important group of flower visiting animals. Both male and female bees feed on nectar, and the females collect pollen to feed the larvae. Bee flowers (flowers coevolved with bees) like Fivespot often have distinctive markings by which bees can quickly recognize them.DISTRIBUTION: Meadows, woodlands, and roadbanks in the Sierra Nevada and Sacramento Valley; 60-3100 m.","The corolla of Fumitory consists of a spurred upper petal, two inner petals, and a lower one. The wings of the upper petal and apex of the inner petals are blackish-red. Hundreds of alien species have been introduced into California and are now naturalized and reproducing on their own. Some are escaped garden ornamentals while others arrived with crop seeds or in animal feed. Fumitory is one of the additions to our wildflower inventory that has not significantly modified its new adopted habitat. Because they lack predators, many alien species can take over entire hillsides, totally displace native vegetation, and in some cases cause native species to go extinct.DISTRIBUTION: Local and uncommon in moist coastal areas of the San Francisco Bay Area; < 200 m; native to western Europe.","The herbaceous saxifrage family, which consists of about 40 genera and 700 species, is almost cosmopolitan in distribution. The majority of species, however, occur in the north temperate region, especially eastern Asia, the Himalayas, and in North America. Despite its restriction to southwestern Oregon and California, Indian Rhubarb looks distinctly tropical. Early in the spring before the leaves appear, flowers are produced in broad flat-topped clusters at the end of a meter long flower stalk called a scape. Umbrella-like leaves erupt from fleshy underground stems and enlarge throughout the growing season.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon along rocky streambanks from the Klamath and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 2000 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","Arctostaphylos is famous for its red peeling bark and sinuous twisting branches. This Manzanita is variable in stature. Some individuals growing in forests can become 2 meters tall. Other individuals growing in rocky exposed sites form prostrate, ground-hugging shrubs as low as 15 centimeters (less than a foot) tall. The white flowers are produced in late winter, long before the appearance of other spring wildflowers. The urn-shaped, pendant flowers are visited by bees that remove pollen from the apical-pored anthers by a vibratory buzzing mechanism.DISTRIBUTION: Rocky sites, woodlands, and coniferous forests from the North Coast and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 600 m.","The white flowers of this common Mariposa Lily do not have to compete for attention among the ephemeral annual spring flora. In late summer its neighbors are more likely to be golden brown grasses instead of brightly colored wildflowers. Like many Mariposa Lilies, the floral configuration of this species resembles an inverted bell. The petals are typically white but vary to smoky-blue with a flush of pink. Each petal has a black spot positioned above the nectary which may well serve as a nectar guide for potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Common in open gravelly sites in chaparral and montane coniferous forests; 1300-4000 m.","Monterey Ceanothus is a prized garden shrub because of its dense intricate habit and small dark green leaves that are clustered on short lateral branchlets. Its flowers are very typical of the Rhamnaceae or Buckthorn family. They are small and bisexual with five sepals and five incurved concave petals, each of which envelops or closely subtends a stamen. The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif.

Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters.

The tapered oval leaves have a checkerboard appearance with veins parallel to the central vein, and connecting transverse veinlets. Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley) and Great Basin Province; < 3400 m.","The name Mock Orange refers both to the appearance of the flowers and to their captivating fragrance. This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing.

The Monterey populations of this species seem to thrive in a region that can receive as many as 135 foggy days in the course of a year.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in sandy hills, flats, and closed-cone pine forests from the southern San Francisco Bay Area to San Luis Obispo Co. on the Central Coast; < 200 m.","The flowers of this Navarettia are crowded into spherical clusters. Each flower is subtended by a 3-lobed leaf-like bract. Bracts typically differ from ordinary leaves in both size and shape. In this species they give the flower cluster a spike-like appearance which may function to discourage browsing predators.DISTRIBUTION: Open, wet areas, meadows, and vernal pools from the Klamath, North Coast, and Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada Foothills, Great Central Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, and South Coast Ranges; < 1800 m.","The species has a distinctive pattern of peeling bark that accounts for its common name. Ninebark belongs to the rose family which includes a cornucopia of economically important plants. Apples, cherries, pears, peaches, apricots, almonds, and quince are a few of the useful members of this family. Fruit types in the Rosaceae range from pomes (apples) and drupes (cherries) to achenes (strawberries) and follicles. The fruit of Ninebark is an inflated follicle which is a dry few-seeded fruit that releases it seeds along two lateral sutures. Ninebark puts on a spectacular summer show with large umbel-like clusters of white flowers that are followed by vibrant clusters of red fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Moist banks, north-facing slopes, and coniferous forests throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except Great Central Valley); < 1400 m.","Milkweeds and butterflies often form mutually beneficial relationships. What is advantageous and protective to the Monarch butterfly, for example, can be deadly to other small insects. Caterpillars feed on certain poisonous milkweeds which make them harmful to birds. Milkweeds have their pollen clustered in masses called pollinia but only the stronger, larger individuals can manipulate a flower to extract the pollen without getting tangled and trapped in the complex floral architecture.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in many habitats (incl. fields and roadsides) throughout Calif.; 0-1900 m.","The name Snowdrop refers to the snow white nut-like fruit and not to the color of the flower. Both the fruit and the brilliant white flowers stand out in their shadowy woodland habitat. Therefore, this uncommon plant is relatively easy to spot. Each pendant flower has twice as many stamens as petals and the staminal filaments form a tube around the the pistil. Resins derived from species related to Snowdrop are used as an antiseptic (resin storax) and in incense.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in dry places in chaparral and woodland from the High and Inner North Coast Ranges, Cascade Ranges, Sierra Nevada, Outer South Coast Ranges, W Transverse Ranges, San Bernardino Mts., and Peninsular Ranges; < 1500 m.","Tree Anemone is an erect shrub with distinctive peeling bark that attains a height of nearly three meters. Each flower consists of 4-7 brilliant white petals that form a backdrop for a radiant whorl of yellow stamens. The flowers are typically arranged in a grouping called a cyme. This is a flat-topped or convex flower cluster with central flowers opening first.DISTRIBUTION: Rare along streambanks, chaparral, and oak woodland in the central and southern Sierra Nevada Foothills; 450-1000 m.","Look in fresh water and mud for the water plantain. The tapered oval leaves have a checkerboard appearance with veins parallel to the central vein, and connecting transverse veinlets. Flowers have three sepals and three smooth-edged white to pinkish petals. They are arranged in a pyramid.DISTRIBUTION: Margins of ponds in valleys and mountains throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1600 m.","The typically showy structure in higher plants that we call a flower functions to attract potential pollinators through the presentation of food or other rewards and the production of viable seeds for a successive generation. Flowers are pollinated by diverse agents such as insects, birds, bats, non-flying mammals, wind, and water. Ants visit flowers to feed on pollen and nectar. They are not good pollinators, however, because they move slowly from plant to plant, tend to visit few flowers, and are not equipped to carry pollen for long distances. The Western Campion has sticky glandular hairs on its stems that appear to discourage non-flying insects from crawling to the flowers to thieve pollen or nectar.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral and coniferous forests from the high southern Cascade Ranges and Modoc Plateau to the northern High Sierra Nevada; 700-2300 m.","True green petals are rare among California wildflowers but not particularly uncommon in tropical regions. The White Brodiaea is one of the rare local examples with matching white petals and sepals accentuated with green venation. This species can often be found around the vernal pools that are formed by the runoff of winter rains into a depression. Since there is no outflow from the depression, water is lost only through evaporation.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and vernally wet meadows from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada, Great Central Valley and northern and central portions of CW Calif.; 0-2000 m.","What is that robust spike of white flowers out in the middle of the bog? Its preference for water-logged habitats makes this orchid less accessible and all the more enticing. The gentle curve of the petals brings to mind a Georgia O'Keefe painting. In orchids, the lower petal in a flower is called the lip. In this species it curves forward and also has a dilated cylindrical extension at its base called a spur. The two upper petals fuse with the uppermost sepal to form a hood which arches over the column. The column or central part of the flower is formed by the fusion of stamens, style, and stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Wet open places and meadows throughout the Calif. Floristic Province (except the Great Central Valley) and Great Basin Province; < 3400 m.","The name Mock Orange refers both to the appearance of the flowers and to their captivating fragrance. This deciduous shrub of 3-5 meters has opposite, nearly chartreuse leaves borne on straight branches that were once used in making shafts for arrows. Each flower has four sepals, four petals, many stamens, and an inferior to half-inferior ovary. Describing the ovary as inferior does not infer any kind of value judgment. It means that the position of the ovary is below the level of attachment for other flower parts.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes, canyons, and forest openings from NW Calif. and the Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; < 1500 m.","The utilitarian yarrow should not be considered a weed. In Sweden, it is used as a substitute for hops in brewing beer. In dry areas (like California), it can be a lawn substitute. It does not require irrigation and tolerates mowing. When left unmowed the 1-2 foot feathery-leaved stems produce a flat cluster of flowers, consisting of both ray and disk flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Many habitats throughout Calif. except the deserts; < 3500 m.","The moisture loving Yerba Mansa has spinach-like leaves that arise from a stout aromatic rhizome (underground stem). It thrives in saline and alkaline soils that many plants find inhospitable. You are not observing one flower but a whole group of flowers arranged in an elongate cluster that superficially resembles an anemone flower. What look like petals are in fact white petaloid bracts (modified leaves). Each flower of 6 or 8 stamens and 3 fused pistils is subtended by a smaller white bract.DISTRIBUTION: Common in saline or alkaline soil, wet or moist areas, seeps, and springs from the sw Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay Area, South Coast and South Coast Ranges to the northern and southern Channel Islands, Peninsular Ranges, and Mojave Desert; 75-1700 m."
