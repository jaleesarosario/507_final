"Baby Blue-eyes are annuals. The seeds that are dropped from the dry capsules of mature plants bake throughout the dry season and start to germinate with arrival of the first rains. If a botanist wants to conduct an inventory of all plants growing in a region, he or she must inspect the same area numerous times during the course of several years. One may find the flowers of an annual species on a spring hike. During a subsequent visit weeks or even months later there may be no detectable evidence of an annual species. Because the environmental conditions that trigger growth and flowering vary from year to year, annuals may not always be conspicuous elements of a local flora.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands, chaparral, wooded slopes and desert washes throughout the Calif. Floristic Province to the Mojave Desert; 15-1600 m.","Many species of Penstemon hold their trumpet-shaped flowers well above the foliage. The trumpet, or corolla, in this species is brilliant blue-purple and attracts a variety of flying insects. Floral rewards in Penstemon take the form of pollen and nectar which are ""packaged"" in the anthers and nectaries respectively. Differences in corolla shape, stamen morphology, and leaf shape provide useful characters for distinguishing the many species of Penstemon in California. The genus Penstemon has the largest number of species of any flowering plant group restricted to North America.DISTRIBUTION: Foothill and montane forests from the Sierra Nevada to the western Transverse Ranges; 400-2500 m.","Blue-eyed grass does not look like a typical iris. What looks like six equal petals are really three sepals alternating with three petals. They just happen to be alike in color and texture. In other irises, the three sepals spread outward and are called falls. The three ""real"" petals, which are more robust, are called standards. The fall is a sepal and not a petal. Typically, sepals are green and look much like modified leaves. In most irises, however, the sepals are highly modified and look like petals.DISTRIBUTION: Open grassy areas and woodlands throughout much of Calif.; mostly < 2400 m.","Mature individuals of Feltleaf Ceanothus can become 7 meters tall (about 23 feet). The species name arboreus refers to this treelike stature. When in full bloom, Ceanothus is a breathtaking sight. The small but showy blue flowers are borne in hundreds of panicles or umbel-like cymes. Following pollination, each flower develops into a roughened 3-lobed triangular capsule that is almost black at maturity.DISTRIBUTION: Dry shrubby slopes on the Channel Islands; < 300 m.","The flower parts of flax are arranged in multiples of five: five sepals, five petals, five stamens, five spherical stigmas, and ten seeds. The striking blue flowers sit on delicate wiry stems with alternately arranged linear leaves. The related European species, Linum usitatissimum is cultivated commercially for the production of flax and linseed oil.DISTRIBUTION: Open slopes and forest margins throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; 400-2000 m.","The five sepals and four petals of the Larkspur fit together like a puzzle. Four of the sepals spread outward. The fifth uppermost sepal has a spur projecting backwards toward the pedicel of the flower. Nectar-bearing spurs of the two upper petals fit into the spur of the upper sepal. The two lower petals are small and hairy. Young plants and seeds of Larkspur are particularly poisonous to cattle. These plants are reportedly responsible for more cattle loss than any other group of poisonous plants. Horses, however, do not graze plants in sufficient quantities to be poisoned and sheep appear to be resistant to Larkspur toxicity.DISTRIBUTION: Moist meadows from the High Sierra Nevada to the Warner Mountains; 1900-2600 m.","Flowers in the Borage or Forget-me-not family are often delicate and showy. The petals are united at the base to form a short tube with five free lobes that spread widely. The appendages arising from the base of each petal create a pattern which looks like a flower within a flower. This may serve as a visual cue for potential pollinators.
