"The name of this species honors Henry N. Bolander (1831-1897) who emigrated to the United States from Germany at the age of 15. Bolander made extensive collections of California plants from 1863-1875. Among his most notable botanical contributions is a paper entitled ""A Catalogue of Plants Growing in the Vicinity of San Francisco"" which was published in 1870.DISTRIBUTION: Bluffs, canyons, and montane slopes in NW Calif.; < 1400 m.","A plant of Cleveland Sage perfumes the air for a distance of as much as 20 feet with an enticing herbal scent. As with the 900 other species of sage worldwide, the seeds are edible. Native Americans would roast the seeds, grind them and mix them with water. The result is a nutritious porridge.DISTRIBUTION: Chaparral, dry slopes, and coastal scrub from the southern South Coast to the southern Peninsular Ranges; < 1000 m.","Erigeron divergens is a member of the Asteraceae, a worldwide family of over 20,000 species. This particular daisy typically grows in the plant community called desert scrub. Desert annuals like Erigeron divergens germinate soon after the onset of winter rains. The plants then mature and form seeds before the long dry season begins. Seeds are durable and can survive for years, waiting to germinate in a ""banner year"" when rains are especially heavy.DISTRIBUTION: Desert scrub and yellow pine forest from S Sierra Nevada to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges east to the Desert and Great Basin Provinces; 500-2600 m.","The corolla of this species consists of petals that are fused into a tube. When all of the petals of a flower are fused together the corolla is described as sympetalous or gamopetalous. This condition, which characterizes entire families of flowering plants, is considered to be a derived or advanced character state. A sympetalous corolla typically consists of three parts—the lobes, the throat, and the tube. The throat is the somewhat widened opening into the tube and the lobes make up the conspicuous flared apex. The size, shape, and coloration of the corolla and its parts, along with other characters, are useful in distinguishing different species of Linanthus.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon in open grassy flats generally in sandy soil from the North and Central Coast to the San Francisco Bay Area; < 1200 m.","The seaside daisy can deal with shifting sand dunes and scouring sea breezes that would create stress for less tolerant species. The flowers produced in this environment are elegantly sculpted combinations of dusty yellow, bright lavender, and seafoam green.DISTRIBUTION: Coastal bluffs, dunes, and beaches from the North, Central, and Outer South Coast Ranges to the northern Channel Islands; < 200 m.","The name Monardella purpurea means little purple Monarda. Monarda is named for Nicolas Monardes, A Renaissance Spanish physician and botanist. The leaves are green or green flushed with purple; everything  else (stems, bracts, calyx lobes, and corolla) is purple. Bracts are modified leaf-like structures that subtend the flower head. The calyx is the hairy ring of fused sepals that envelops the flower tube at its base.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon on rocky slopes (often serpentine), chaparral, woodland, and montane forests from the Klamath and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area and Outer South Coast Ranges; 400-1400 m.","The name of this species honors Henry N.
