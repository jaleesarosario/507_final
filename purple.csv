"This delicate vine with intensely purple flowers climbs exuberantly over grassy slopes. It puts on a solo performance as it often flowers after the showy displays of our spring wildflowers. The vetch flower is typical of the papilionoid subfamily of legumes. The two lower petals in each flower are fused into a keel. The two lateral petals are called wings. The broad uppermost petal is called the banner. The stamens and pistil are obscured by the folded keel. When a heavy bee seeking nectar lands on the flower, the keel bends downward and pollen is brushed onto the bee's abdomen. As the bee manipulates another flower in the same manner it deposits its pollen load on a receptive stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Disturbed areas and moist forests often along streams throughout the Great Basin and Calif. Floristic Provinces; < 2400 m.","There are five pairs of purple spots or ""eyes"" in the throat of Bird's Eye Gilia. These spots, which are best seen in profile view, punctuate the color change from the violet lobes above to the bright yellow throat below. The open branching pattern of this species and its finely lobed leaves appear to present the flowers to their best advantage to potential pollinators. At times the flower clusters appear to be suspended in mid-air against the backdrop of a grassy field.DISTRIBUTION: Open grassy hills and valleys from the North and South Coast Ranges to the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada Foothills; < 1200 m.","There has been a long history of coevolution between flowering plants and their pollinating agents. Each group of flower visiting animals is associated with a special group of floral features that are in turn related to the visual and olfactory senses of the animals they attract. The large-flowered species of Trichostema are pollinated by bees or hummingbirds. The small-flowered species like T. oblongum, however, produce little or no nectar and attract relatively few flower visitors. The anthers of this Bluecurl are adjacent to the stigma and self-pollination results from the stigma brushing against freshly dehisced anthers.DISTRIBUTION: Dry meadow margins and streambanks from the North Coast to the Klamath and Cascade Ranges, Modoc Plateau and the Sierra Nevada; 100-3000 m.","Blue-eyed grass does not look like a typical iris. What looks like six equal petals are really three sepals alternating with three petals. They just happen to be alike in color and texture. In other irises, the three sepals spread outward and are called falls. The three ""real"" petals, which are more robust, are called standards. The fall is a sepal and not a petal. Typically, sepals are green and look much like modified leaves. In most irises, however, the sepals are highly modified and look like petals.DISTRIBUTION: Open grassy areas and woodlands throughout much of Calif.; mostly < 2400 m.","The name of this species honors Henry N. Bolander (1831-1897) who emigrated to the United States from Germany at the age of 15. Bolander made extensive collections of California plants from 1863-1875. Among his most notable botanical contributions is a paper entitled ""A Catalogue of Plants Growing in the Vicinity of San Francisco"" which was published in 1870.DISTRIBUTION: Bluffs, canyons, and montane slopes in NW Calif.; < 1400 m.","The perianth of Bridges' Triteleia consists of three sepals and three petals that are alike in color and texture. The flowers are further characterized by six stamens and a solitary style that is terminated by a three-lobed stigma. The genus Triteleia, therefore, was named for tri—three—because all flower parts are in threes. A notable feature of Bridges' Triteleia is the translucent and shiny throat of the flower. Nothing is known about the functional significance of this pattern in attracting potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Forest margins, often on rocks, from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the foothills of the Cascade Ranges and Sierra Nevada; 0-100 m.","Lupines are resourceful plants that grow in rocky rubble and on sand dunes where their root system may reach a depth of 20 feet. More importantly, lupines can obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere with the help of Rhizobium, a bacterium which grows in nodular swellings on the roots. These bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen into organic compounds in a process called nitrogen fixation. This symbiotic relationship allows the lupine to grow in nutrient poor soils. In return the lupine serves as a host that supplies energy-rich carbon compounds to the bacteria.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy or rocky habitats throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2000 m.","This is one of California's showiest native wildflowers. The yellow, white, and purple color combination of the lower petals serve as a landing platform for bees and other pollinators. The corolla consists of two narrow ascending petals and three fused petals below. Look carefully at the landing platform and you will see the notches and pleats marking the sites of petal fusion.DISTRIBUTION: Boggy places near lakes, ponds, vernal pools, and mt. meadows in the Klamath and Cascade Ranges; < 1650 m.","This species was sent to England by David Douglas in 1833. Douglas was a British plant collector who scoured the west coast and Hawaii from 1825 to 1834 searching for new species. In Europe, gardening was so popular during the 19th century that explorers risked their lives to bring that never-before-seen plant to the garden trade. Chinese Houses is a common annual with showy flowers. The corolla consists of a short tube with two somewhat reflexed white to lavender upper lobes and three purple lower lobes. The upper pair of stamen filaments have an erect spur that projects upward into the nectar pouch.DISTRIBUTION: Common in shady places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1000 m.",The coarsely toothed leaves of Common Vervain are best developed at the base of the plant and become reduced in sized upward along the stem. Each flower in the spike-like inflorescence has fused petals forming a tube that expands into five flared lobes. The stems are square or four-angled as they are in the closely related mint family. The latter family differs consistently from the vervains in producing essential oils (hence the fragrance) and in having a deeply four-lobed ovary.DISTRIBUTION: Wet or dry open places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2500 m.,"The basic parts of a typical flower are the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistil. In some species of flowering plants the stamens are modified into structures called staminodes which are rudimentary or sterile stamens that do not produce pollen. The broad incurved staminodes of Dwarf Brodiaea are attached to the petal-like sepals and alternate with the fertile stamens.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and open woodlands from the North Coast Ranges to central western Calif.; 0-450 m.","Many handsome Gentian species occur in high mountain areas. Much research has been done on animal adaptations to the harsh conditions of high elevation habitats but less is known about the many species of plants that live at these heights. Most members of this genus are adapted to the contrasting conditions of very cold winters and long summer days. The delicate petals with feathery appendages superficially look ill-suited for the harsh seasonal climate. They thrive, however, in vast mountain meadows that John Muir called ""gentian meadows"".DISTRIBUTION: Wet mountain meadows and slopes from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada; 1300-3900 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sections—Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.",The pompom-like sphere of flowers sits atop a 25-50 cm long stem. Most of the plant's leaves are clustered at the base. The violet-blue corolla consists of 5 petals fused into a tube. The sepals which are also fused into a short tube have ridges with green ribs alternating with violet membranes. These membranes appear to expand in accordion-like fashion with maturation of the enclosed capsular fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes and coastal bluffs along the northern and central North Coast; < 300 m.,"Glancing at the iris, one sees no stamens or pistils—the pollen and seed producing parts of the flower. They are well protected and hidden from view. The pistil or ""female organ"" consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. Generally the style is a slender tubelike structure connecting the stigma which receives pollen to the ovary where seeds form. In this flower the style looks like another petal. The style is readily identified because it is topped by two arches called crests.DISTRIBUTION: Common in grassy places near the coast from NW to SW Calif.; < 100 (-1000) m.","The five sepals and four petals of the Larkspur fit together like a puzzle. Four of the sepals spread outward. The fifth uppermost sepal has a spur projecting backwards toward the pedicel of the flower. Nectar-bearing spurs of the two upper petals fit into the spur of the upper sepal. The two lower petals are small and hairy. Young plants and seeds of Larkspur are particularly poisonous to cattle. These plants are reportedly responsible for more cattle loss than any other group of poisonous plants. Horses, however, do not graze plants in sufficient quantities to be poisoned and sheep appear to be resistant to Larkspur toxicity.DISTRIBUTION: Moist meadows from the High Sierra Nevada to the Warner Mountains; 1900-2600 m.","This stout lupine is commonly found in bogs. The leaves are composed of several individual leaflets joined at a central point. This arrangement is called palmately compound. The term ""palmate"" refers to a configuration resembling the outstretched fingers of your hand. The term ""compound"" refers to the leaf being divided into many leaflets. In this lupine, the leaf can be as big as a dinner plate.DISTRIBUTION: DISTRIUBTION: Wet places from the High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; 1500-3000 m.","The name Monardella purpurea means little purple Monarda. Monarda is named for Nicolas Monardes, A Renaissance Spanish physician and botanist. The leaves are green or green flushed with purple; everything  else (stems, bracts, calyx lobes, and corolla) is purple. Bracts are modified leaf-like structures that subtend the flower head. The calyx is the hairy ring of fused sepals that envelops the flower tube at its base.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon on rocky slopes (often serpentine), chaparral, woodland, and montane forests from the Klamath and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area and Outer South Coast Ranges; 400-1400 m.","This member of the mint family has a 2-lipped flower. The upper lip is hoodlike and the lower one is 3-lobed. The calyx which surrounds the floral tube at its base looks like the shape created when pinching the edge of a pie crust. Despite its small size (10-35 cm) and rather diffuse habit, this Skullcap is not often overlooked because of its handsome purple or violet-blue flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Dry rocky, often serpentine slopes, oak woodland and coniferous forests from NW Calif. to the Modoc Plateau and northern Sierra Nevada Foothills; < 2000 m.","Flowers in the Borage or Forget-me-not family are often delicate and showy. The petals are united at the base to form a short tube with five free lobes that spread widely. The appendages arising from the base of each petal create a pattern which looks like a flower within a flower. This may serve as a visual cue for potential pollinators. The 4-lobed ovary which houses developing seeds and the pollen-producing stamens are located deep in the flower tube hidden from view.DISTRIBUTION: Open slopes, forest clearings and roadsides from the High Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; 1300-2500 m.","Like all species of Viola, the five petals of this species are of unequal size with the lowermost pair forming a prominent spur. Nectar is secreted into the spur from the bases of the two lowermost stamens. Pollinators are guided into this spur by lined markings on the petals. The pollinated flower of Western Dog Violet matures into a small capsule containing the seeds. The valves or units of the capsule wall shrink when dry, forcibly ejecting the seeds. Thus, violets have a built-in mechanisn that insures seed dispersal.DISTRIBUTION: Damp banks, grassy meadows, and forest margins generally in the mountains of the Calif. Floristic Province; < 3500 m.","An introductory text would tell you that a sunflower such as this Aster is really a bouquet of many flowers. The outer violet petals are in fact ray florets (small flowers). They are sterile but serve to attract pollinators such as bees. The central area consists of disk florets. Male pollen-bearing flowers are at the bull's eye of the target pattern. Female seed-producing flowers form a circle around the bullseye. Because the aster is not a single flower but, in fact, consists of numerous flowers, it is referred to as a ""compound inflorescence"".DISTRIBUTION: Meadows from northwestern Calif. through the Sierra Nevada south to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges east to the Great Basin Province; 1200-2800 m.","This delicate vine with intensely purple flowers climbs exuberantly over grassy slopes.

The calyx is the hairy ring of fused sepals that envelops the flower tube at its base.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon on rocky slopes (often serpentine), chaparral, woodland, and montane forests from the Klamath and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area and Outer South Coast Ranges; 400-1400 m.","This member of the mint family has a 2-lipped flower. The upper lip is hoodlike and the lower one is 3-lobed. The calyx which surrounds the floral tube at its base looks like the shape created when pinching the edge of a pie crust. Despite its small size (10-35 cm) and rather diffuse habit, this Skullcap is not often overlooked because of its handsome purple or violet-blue flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Dry rocky, often serpentine slopes, oak woodland and coniferous forests from NW Calif. to the Modoc Plateau and northern Sierra Nevada Foothills; < 2000 m.","Flowers in the Borage or Forget-me-not family are often delicate and showy. The petals are united at the base to form a short tube with five free lobes that spread widely. The appendages arising from the base of each petal create a pattern which looks like a flower within a flower. This may serve as a visual cue for potential pollinators. The 4-lobed ovary which houses developing seeds and the pollen-producing stamens are located deep in the flower tube hidden from view.DISTRIBUTION: Open slopes, forest clearings and roadsides from the High Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; 1300-2500 m.","Like all species of Viola, the five petals of this species are of unequal size with the lowermost pair forming a prominent spur. Nectar is secreted into the spur from the bases of the two lowermost stamens. Pollinators are guided into this spur by lined markings on the petals.

Douglas was a British plant collector who scoured the west coast and Hawaii from 1825 to 1834 searching for new species. In Europe, gardening was so popular during the 19th century that explorers risked their lives to bring that never-before-seen plant to the garden trade. Chinese Houses is a common annual with showy flowers. The corolla consists of a short tube with two somewhat reflexed white to lavender upper lobes and three purple lower lobes. The upper pair of stamen filaments have an erect spur that projects upward into the nectar pouch.DISTRIBUTION: Common in shady places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1000 m.",The coarsely toothed leaves of Common Vervain are best developed at the base of the plant and become reduced in sized upward along the stem. Each flower in the spike-like inflorescence has fused petals forming a tube that expands into five flared lobes. The stems are square or four-angled as they are in the closely related mint family. The latter family differs consistently from the vervains in producing essential oils (hence the fragrance) and in having a deeply four-lobed ovary.DISTRIBUTION: Wet or dry open places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2500 m.,"The basic parts of a typical flower are the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistil. In some species of flowering plants the stamens are modified into structures called staminodes which are rudimentary or sterile stamens that do not produce pollen. The broad incurved staminodes of Dwarf Brodiaea are attached to the petal-like sepals and alternate with the fertile stamens.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and open woodlands from the North Coast Ranges to central western Calif.; 0-450 m.","Many handsome Gentian species occur in high mountain areas. Much research has been done on animal adaptations to the harsh conditions of high elevation habitats but less is known about the many species of plants that live at these heights. Most members of this genus are adapted to the contrasting conditions of very cold winters and long summer days. The delicate petals with feathery appendages superficially look ill-suited for the harsh seasonal climate. They thrive, however, in vast mountain meadows that John Muir called ""gentian meadows"".DISTRIBUTION: Wet mountain meadows and slopes from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada; 1300-3900 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sections—Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.",The pompom-like sphere of flowers sits atop a 25-50 cm long stem. Most of the plant's leaves are clustered at the base. The violet-blue corolla consists of 5 petals fused into a tube. The sepals which are also fused into a short tube have ridges with green ribs alternating with violet membranes. These membranes appear to expand in accordion-like fashion with maturation of the enclosed capsular fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes and coastal bluffs along the northern and central North Coast; < 300 m.,"Glancing at the iris, one sees no stamens or pistils—the pollen and seed producing parts of the flower. They are well protected and hidden from view. The pistil or ""female organ"" consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. Generally the style is a slender tubelike structure connecting the stigma which receives pollen to the ovary where seeds form. In this flower the style looks like another petal. The style is readily identified because it is topped by two arches called crests.DISTRIBUTION: Common in grassy places near the coast from NW to SW Calif.; < 100 (-1000) m.","The five sepals and four petals of the Larkspur fit together like a puzzle. Four of the sepals spread outward. The fifth uppermost sepal has a spur projecting backwards toward the pedicel of the flower. Nectar-bearing spurs of the two upper petals fit into the spur of the upper sepal. The two lower petals are small and hairy. Young plants and seeds of Larkspur are particularly poisonous to cattle. These plants are reportedly responsible for more cattle loss than any other group of poisonous plants. Horses, however, do not graze plants in sufficient quantities to be poisoned and sheep appear to be resistant to Larkspur toxicity.DISTRIBUTION: Moist meadows from the High Sierra Nevada to the Warner Mountains; 1900-2600 m.","This stout lupine is commonly found in bogs.

They thrive, however, in vast mountain meadows that John Muir called ""gentian meadows"".DISTRIBUTION: Wet mountain meadows and slopes from the Klamath and High Cascade Ranges to the High Sierra Nevada; 1300-3900 m.","One might ask why this subspecies received the name bicolor in view of the fact that its flowers have pink corolla lobes, a yellow throat, and occasional purple striping. Scientific names are not always descriptive. It seems likely that the author of this taxon chose to emphasize the two colors that are invariably present in each flower. The 70 species of Gilia can be divided into two taxonomic groupings technically referred to as sections—Arachnion and Kelloggia. Species in the former section are characterized by cobwebby hairs in the leaf axils and the latter lack these hairs. This Gilia belongs to the second grouping.DISTRIBUTION: Locally common in open rocky areas in forests and meadows of the central and southern High Sierra Nevada; 2200-3100 m.",The pompom-like sphere of flowers sits atop a 25-50 cm long stem. Most of the plant's leaves are clustered at the base. The violet-blue corolla consists of 5 petals fused into a tube. The sepals which are also fused into a short tube have ridges with green ribs alternating with violet membranes. These membranes appear to expand in accordion-like fashion with maturation of the enclosed capsular fruits.DISTRIBUTION: Slopes and coastal bluffs along the northern and central North Coast; < 300 m.,"Glancing at the iris, one sees no stamens or pistils—the pollen and seed producing parts of the flower. They are well protected and hidden from view. The pistil or ""female organ"" consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. Generally the style is a slender tubelike structure connecting the stigma which receives pollen to the ovary where seeds form. In this flower the style looks like another petal. The style is readily identified because it is topped by two arches called crests.DISTRIBUTION: Common in grassy places near the coast from NW to SW Calif.; < 100 (-1000) m.","The five sepals and four petals of the Larkspur fit together like a puzzle. Four of the sepals spread outward. The fifth uppermost sepal has a spur projecting backwards toward the pedicel of the flower. Nectar-bearing spurs of the two upper petals fit into the spur of the upper sepal. The two lower petals are small and hairy. Young plants and seeds of Larkspur are particularly poisonous to cattle. These plants are reportedly responsible for more cattle loss than any other group of poisonous plants. Horses, however, do not graze plants in sufficient quantities to be poisoned and sheep appear to be resistant to Larkspur toxicity.DISTRIBUTION: Moist meadows from the High Sierra Nevada to the Warner Mountains; 1900-2600 m.","This stout lupine is commonly found in bogs. The leaves are composed of several individual leaflets joined at a central point. This arrangement is called palmately compound. The term ""palmate"" refers to a configuration resembling the outstretched fingers of your hand. The term ""compound"" refers to the leaf being divided into many leaflets. In this lupine, the leaf can be as big as a dinner plate.DISTRIBUTION: DISTRIUBTION: Wet places from the High Sierra Nevada and Great Basin Province to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges; 1500-3000 m.","The name Monardella purpurea means little purple Monarda. Monarda is named for Nicolas Monardes, A Renaissance Spanish physician and botanist. The leaves are green or green flushed with purple; everything  else (stems, bracts, calyx lobes, and corolla) is purple. Bracts are modified leaf-like structures that subtend the flower head. The calyx is the hairy ring of fused sepals that envelops the flower tube at its base.DISTRIBUTION: Uncommon on rocky slopes (often serpentine), chaparral, woodland, and montane forests from the Klamath and Outer North Coast Ranges to the San Francisco Bay Area and Outer South Coast Ranges; 400-1400 m.","This member of the mint family has a 2-lipped flower. The upper lip is hoodlike and the lower one is 3-lobed. The calyx which surrounds the floral tube at its base looks like the shape created when pinching the edge of a pie crust. Despite its small size (10-35 cm) and rather diffuse habit, this Skullcap is not often overlooked because of its handsome purple or violet-blue flowers.DISTRIBUTION: Dry rocky, often serpentine slopes, oak woodland and coniferous forests from NW Calif. to the Modoc Plateau and northern Sierra Nevada Foothills; < 2000 m.","Flowers in the Borage or Forget-me-not family are often delicate and showy. The petals are united at the base to form a short tube with five free lobes that spread widely. The appendages arising from the base of each petal create a pattern which looks like a flower within a flower. This may serve as a visual cue for potential pollinators. The 4-lobed ovary which houses developing seeds and the pollen-producing stamens are located deep in the flower tube hidden from view.DISTRIBUTION: Open slopes, forest clearings and roadsides from the High Cascade Ranges to the Sierra Nevada; 1300-2500 m.","Like all species of Viola, the five petals of this species are of unequal size with the lowermost pair forming a prominent spur. Nectar is secreted into the spur from the bases of the two lowermost stamens. Pollinators are guided into this spur by lined markings on the petals. The pollinated flower of Western Dog Violet matures into a small capsule containing the seeds. The valves or units of the capsule wall shrink when dry, forcibly ejecting the seeds. Thus, violets have a built-in mechanisn that insures seed dispersal.DISTRIBUTION: Damp banks, grassy meadows, and forest margins generally in the mountains of the Calif. Floristic Province; < 3500 m.","An introductory text would tell you that a sunflower such as this Aster is really a bouquet of many flowers. The outer violet petals are in fact ray florets (small flowers). They are sterile but serve to attract pollinators such as bees. The central area consists of disk florets. Male pollen-bearing flowers are at the bull's eye of the target pattern. Female seed-producing flowers form a circle around the bullseye. Because the aster is not a single flower but, in fact, consists of numerous flowers, it is referred to as a ""compound inflorescence"".DISTRIBUTION: Meadows from northwestern Calif. through the Sierra Nevada south to the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges east to the Great Basin Province; 1200-2800 m.","This delicate vine with intensely purple flowers climbs exuberantly over grassy slopes. It puts on a solo performance as it often flowers after the showy displays of our spring wildflowers. The vetch flower is typical of the papilionoid subfamily of legumes. The two lower petals in each flower are fused into a keel. The two lateral petals are called wings. The broad uppermost petal is called the banner. The stamens and pistil are obscured by the folded keel. When a heavy bee seeking nectar lands on the flower, the keel bends downward and pollen is brushed onto the bee's abdomen. As the bee manipulates another flower in the same manner it deposits its pollen load on a receptive stigma.DISTRIBUTION: Disturbed areas and moist forests often along streams throughout the Great Basin and Calif. Floristic Provinces; < 2400 m.","There are five pairs of purple spots or ""eyes"" in the throat of Bird's Eye Gilia. These spots, which are best seen in profile view, punctuate the color change from the violet lobes above to the bright yellow throat below. The open branching pattern of this species and its finely lobed leaves appear to present the flowers to their best advantage to potential pollinators. At times the flower clusters appear to be suspended in mid-air against the backdrop of a grassy field.DISTRIBUTION: Open grassy hills and valleys from the North and South Coast Ranges to the San Joaquin Valley and Sierra Nevada Foothills; < 1200 m.","There has been a long history of coevolution between flowering plants and their pollinating agents. Each group of flower visiting animals is associated with a special group of floral features that are in turn related to the visual and olfactory senses of the animals they attract. The large-flowered species of Trichostema are pollinated by bees or hummingbirds. The small-flowered species like T. oblongum, however, produce little or no nectar and attract relatively few flower visitors. The anthers of this Bluecurl are adjacent to the stigma and self-pollination results from the stigma brushing against freshly dehisced anthers.DISTRIBUTION: Dry meadow margins and streambanks from the North Coast to the Klamath and Cascade Ranges, Modoc Plateau and the Sierra Nevada; 100-3000 m.","Blue-eyed grass does not look like a typical iris. What looks like six equal petals are really three sepals alternating with three petals. They just happen to be alike in color and texture. In other irises, the three sepals spread outward and are called falls. The three ""real"" petals, which are more robust, are called standards. The fall is a sepal and not a petal. Typically, sepals are green and look much like modified leaves. In most irises, however, the sepals are highly modified and look like petals.DISTRIBUTION: Open grassy areas and woodlands throughout much of Calif.; mostly < 2400 m.","The name of this species honors Henry N. Bolander (1831-1897) who emigrated to the United States from Germany at the age of 15. Bolander made extensive collections of California plants from 1863-1875. Among his most notable botanical contributions is a paper entitled ""A Catalogue of Plants Growing in the Vicinity of San Francisco"" which was published in 1870.DISTRIBUTION: Bluffs, canyons, and montane slopes in NW Calif.; < 1400 m.","The perianth of Bridges' Triteleia consists of three sepals and three petals that are alike in color and texture. The flowers are further characterized by six stamens and a solitary style that is terminated by a three-lobed stigma. The genus Triteleia, therefore, was named for tri—three—because all flower parts are in threes. A notable feature of Bridges' Triteleia is the translucent and shiny throat of the flower. Nothing is known about the functional significance of this pattern in attracting potential pollinators.DISTRIBUTION: Forest margins, often on rocks, from the Klamath and North Coast Ranges to the foothills of the Cascade Ranges and Sierra Nevada; 0-100 m.","Lupines are resourceful plants that grow in rocky rubble and on sand dunes where their root system may reach a depth of 20 feet. More importantly, lupines can obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere with the help of Rhizobium, a bacterium which grows in nodular swellings on the roots. These bacteria can convert atmospheric nitrogen into organic compounds in a process called nitrogen fixation. This symbiotic relationship allows the lupine to grow in nutrient poor soils. In return the lupine serves as a host that supplies energy-rich carbon compounds to the bacteria.DISTRIBUTION: Open sandy or rocky habitats throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2000 m.","This is one of California's showiest native wildflowers. The yellow, white, and purple color combination of the lower petals serve as a landing platform for bees and other pollinators. The corolla consists of two narrow ascending petals and three fused petals below. Look carefully at the landing platform and you will see the notches and pleats marking the sites of petal fusion.DISTRIBUTION: Boggy places near lakes, ponds, vernal pools, and mt. meadows in the Klamath and Cascade Ranges; < 1650 m.","This species was sent to England by David Douglas in 1833. Douglas was a British plant collector who scoured the west coast and Hawaii from 1825 to 1834 searching for new species. In Europe, gardening was so popular during the 19th century that explorers risked their lives to bring that never-before-seen plant to the garden trade. Chinese Houses is a common annual with showy flowers. The corolla consists of a short tube with two somewhat reflexed white to lavender upper lobes and three purple lower lobes. The upper pair of stamen filaments have an erect spur that projects upward into the nectar pouch.DISTRIBUTION: Common in shady places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 1000 m.",The coarsely toothed leaves of Common Vervain are best developed at the base of the plant and become reduced in sized upward along the stem. Each flower in the spike-like inflorescence has fused petals forming a tube that expands into five flared lobes. The stems are square or four-angled as they are in the closely related mint family. The latter family differs consistently from the vervains in producing essential oils (hence the fragrance) and in having a deeply four-lobed ovary.DISTRIBUTION: Wet or dry open places throughout the Calif. Floristic Province; < 2500 m.,"The basic parts of a typical flower are the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistil. In some species of flowering plants the stamens are modified into structures called staminodes which are rudimentary or sterile stamens that do not produce pollen. The broad incurved staminodes of Dwarf Brodiaea are attached to the petal-like sepals and alternate with the fertile stamens.DISTRIBUTION: Grasslands and open woodlands from the North Coast Ranges to central western Calif.; 0-450 m.","Many handsome Gentian species occur in high mountain areas. Much research has been done on animal adaptations to the harsh conditions of high elevation habitats but less is known about the many species of plants that live at these heights. Most members of this genus are adapted to the contrasting conditions of very cold winters and long summer days. The delicate petals with feathery appendages superficially look ill-suited for the harsh seasonal climate.
